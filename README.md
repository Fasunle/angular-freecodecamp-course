# FreecodecampCourse

I want to upgrade my skills to writing angular applications in addition to React.js. So, My first stop is Freecodecamp for understanding the basics of angular.js.

## Parent-to-child binding using @Input() decorator.

we can send data from parent to child by binding the properties with a `Input` decorator. This will make the data dynamic and update in realtime.

## Child-to-parent binding using @Output() decorator.

This decorator works slightly different in that it is combined with event emitter.

So an event is fired from the child. The parent listen to this event and take appropriate actions based on the app needs.

> Here, we just alert the user with the message from the child component.
